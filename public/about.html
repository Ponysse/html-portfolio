<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>
  
<p>My name is Denisse Barrera, I am 33 years old.</p>
<p>In the last year I discovered that I am capable of doing what I set my mind to if I am really interested and motivated. In that discovery emerged fears and doubts about my own self, but I came to the conclusion that I really have nothing to lose by trying and finding challenges along the way. </p>

<p>One of the things that motivate me the most are the challenges, but at the same time they scare me a lot because I fear not being able to overcome them. It was quite hard accepting that because I thought it was a bit pathetic that, after all, everything we read and hear about self-improvement is true, there is no greater enemy than oneself. </p>

<p>After many months of convincing myself that this is true, I am here, trying and at the same time slowly learning and advancing a little bit every day. It's better than staying where I was, isn't it?</p>
<p>Anyway, this process excites me and I hope it stays that way.  </p>
